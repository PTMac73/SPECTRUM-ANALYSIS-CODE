# SPECTRUM-ANALYSIS-CODE
These codes help me to perform various tasks to do with data analysis, from theoretical calculations, to tools that help speed up certain tasks. They are detailed below.

## Data analysis tools
### PtolemyCode
This is a large project to help analyse data using the program Ptolemy (a manual for Ptolemy can be found [here](https://www.phy.anl.gov/theory/ptolemy/ptolemy_manual.pdf "Ptolemy Manual") ). The heart of this code is the "ptolemyBash.sh" script, which takes a pre-defined reaction, and generates a number of Ptolemy output files, which are then wrapped up into a CSV file which can be pasted into a spreadsheet program, where the analysis continues.

### XMGraceMg
This is an auto-plotting tool that I've written to take data in a particular form from a CSV file (that comes from a spreadsheet), and plots the various parts of it in XMGrace. The Mg just denotes the project, as I have different versions for different projects, though hoping to combine into one tool.

## Repetitive task tools
### nameFigure
This renames a given file to have a certain format. I use this tool to keep track of figures in my work diary, by renaming them with the date.

### ScriptHeading
This generates a heading for some code of a given width. Used to make code prettier and easier to read.
